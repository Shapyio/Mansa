# Mansa: Stock Prediction AI

This project is a containerized, modular stock prediction and data analysis system designed for cross-platform development and deployment. The goal is to support prediction logic, web scraping, sentiment analysis, indicators, and API integration—all in a scalable pipeline.

## Getting Started
### ⚙️ How to Build and Run the Project
1. Start the container

Run the following from your project root to spin up your dev environment:

``` bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Attach VSCode to the container

- Open the project in VSCode.
- You should be prompted to "Reopen in Container".
- If not, press `F1` and choose `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.

3. Build the project

From inside the container terminal or via VSCode terminal:

``` bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

4. Run the project

``` bash 
./build/mansa
```

### 🛠️ CMake Notes

- Keep a top-level `CMakeLists.txt` to drive the build.
- Add `CMakeLists.txt` files to subdirectories (`src/`, `test/`) to build targets modularly.
- `cmake/` can contain custom modules or third-party config helpers.

### 🚢 Docker & Containerization

This project is containerized using a multi-container Docker Compose setup, including:

- `dev`: Development container with compilers, CMake, Python, and VSCode features
- `db`: Postgres database container for storing scraped or processed data

You can spin it up using:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## ✍️ Personal Notes

My thoughts here:

- Research models for stock prediction, sentiment analysis, as well as more niche trackers (weather, patterns, etc)
- Explore integration with API for headlines and articles
- Keep notebook with ML experiment results
